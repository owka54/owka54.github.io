  <p>Hi there! I know there isn't much to look at here, I will get around to making my website eventually. <br>
 I am currently learning Python using Codecademy. I have completed the 'Learn Python3' beginner course, and just completed the 'Build Connect 4 using Python' project.
   My next move is to complete the 'Learn Intermediate Python 3' course.</p>
